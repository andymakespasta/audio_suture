Pieces to build:

python commandline merger. 
	base:
		merge all in folder
		filename determines group
		in-betweens already in folder
		runs on my computer and yeh computer (remember list of import/ pip installs)

	python sheets api grab complete list as double check.
		checks if all files in registry are found in folder
			https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python
		registry has column that allows us to nullify inputs (say this one is not wanted.)

	improved output quality:
		equalize volume   --- us ffmpeg filters (loudnorm) ffmpeg-normalize automatically 
			normalize -> concat : removes differences from mic distance and recording equipment.
			concat -> Dynamic Range Compression : reduces differences across a single video.
			https://medium.com/@jud.dagnall/dynamic-range-compression-for-audio-with-ffmpeg-and-compand-621fe2b1a892
		handles video and multiple formats, using the nicer two pass formula
		noise reduction
		front and back empty space removal (may eat up video posture.)?

recorder:
	base:
		generate filename from class and random string to prevent collisions

	selectable suggestions:
		append to filename suggestion

	connected:
		surfaced suggestions taken from sheets API via javascript?
			https://github.com/google/google-api-javascript-client
		save selected and recorded thing to sheets VIA jaavascript API 
			checkmarks blah is done in main list, adds completed recording to registry
			register recordings into separate sheet

	volume suggestion:
		when setting up camera, do a test, and suggest changing the volume if too low



bugs
test4.mkv speeds up and segments soundwhen concat after normalization !?!





notes:
using static build of ffmpeg 4.2.1 + pip install ffmpeg-normalize, ffmpeg override apt installation via PATH=~/audio_suture/ffmpeg-4.2.1-amd64-static:$PATH
